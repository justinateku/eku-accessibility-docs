# Guidelines for Structure & Headings in the Divi Builder

1. **Page Title (h1)**:
   - In the Divi Builder, the page title is typically set automatically as the main heading (h1) for the page. Ensure your page title accurately represents the content of the page.

2. **Section Headings (h2)**:
   - When adding a new section to your page, you can set the section heading as an h2 element.
   - In the section settings, click on the "Advanced" tab, then find the "Heading Level" option, and choose "H2."

3. **Subsection Headings (h3, h4, etc.)**:
   - Within each section, you can add various modules like text modules, image modules, etc.
   - For text modules, you can select the text and use the format dropdown to set the heading level (h3, h4, etc.)
