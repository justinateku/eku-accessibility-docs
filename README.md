# EKU Accessibility Documentation

Welcome to the EKU Accessibility Documentation! This repository contains guidelines for creating and maintaining web content with a strong focus on ensuring accessibility and legibility. Whether you are responsible for updating content or involved in web development, this documentation will assist you in making web content more accessible to all users.

## What is "Accessibility"?

Accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing web content that can be easily accessed and used by people with disabilities. In the context of web content management and web development, it means ensuring that websites and digital resources are designed in a way that accommodates users with visual, auditory, physical, or cognitive impairments.

## Standards We Adhere To

We adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2. WCAG provides a set of internationally recognized standards for web accessibility. By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure that our web content is accessible to a wide range of users. 

Here's a brief introduction video to familiarize you with the concepts involved in the WCAG standards.
