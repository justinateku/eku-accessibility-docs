# Auditing Tools

### WebAIM's WAVE

WebAIM's WAVE is a widely-used web accessibility evaluation tool that offers detailed analysis and reporting of accessibility issues on web pages. It provides a user-friendly interface, making it suitable for individuals with varying levels of technical expertise. WAVE identifies potential accessibility problems and offers suggestions for improvement. It can be used directly in the browser or through browser extensions, enabling users to audit web content in real-time.

### axe DevTools

axe DevTools is a powerful accessibility auditing tool that integrates seamlessly with Chrome Developer Tools. It helps web developers identify and fix accessibility issues during the development process. With axe DevTools, developers can run accessibility tests directly within their development environment, receiving instant feedback and recommendations for resolving issues. The tool provides detailed reports, highlights accessibility violations, and assists in creating more accessible web content.

### Key Differences

While both WAVE and axe DevTools are valuable accessibility auditing tools, there are a few key differences:

- **User Focus**: WAVE is designed with a user-centric approach, allowing users of various technical backgrounds, including web content strategists and managers, to evaluate accessibility. On the other hand, axe DevTools primarily targets web developers and integrates into their existing workflow.

- **Real-Time Auditing**: WAVE offers real-time feedback, allowing users to identify accessibility issues as they browse web pages. In contrast, axe DevTools focuses on auditing web content within the development environment, providing developers with immediate insights during the coding process.

- **Integration**: WAVE can be used directly in the browser or as a browser extension, while axe DevTools is specifically built to integrate with Chrome Developer Tools.

Ultimately, the choice between WAVE and axe DevTools depends on the user's role, preferred workflow, and specific project requirements. Both tools are highly regarded in the accessibility community and contribute to creating more inclusive web experiences.
