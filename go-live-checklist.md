# Go-Live Checklist

Use this checklist as a content manager to ensure that the web pages you update in WordPress, Drupal, or any other content management system adhere to WCAG 2.2 accessibility guidelines. This checklist focuses on actionable steps that content managers can take to enhance accessibility without relying on specific themes or builders.

**Structure and Headings:**
   - Use appropriate heading tags (h1, h2, etc.) to organize content hierarchically.
   - Ensure headings accurately represent the content and provide a clear structure for screen readers and assistive technologies.

**Text and Color Contrast:**
   - Ensure there is sufficient color contrast between the text and background colors to improve readability.
   - Avoid conveying information solely through color, and provide alternative cues such as icons or labels.

**Images and Alt Text:**
   - Add descriptive alternative text (alt text) for images, providing meaningful descriptions that convey their purpose or content.
   - If an image is purely decorative and doesn't convey any important information, mark it as decorative or leave the alt text empty.

**Links and Buttons:**
   - Use descriptive text for link labels that accurately represents the link destination.
   - Ensure buttons have clear and meaningful labels that indicate their purpose or action.

**Multimedia Accessibility:**
   - Provide captions or transcripts for videos to assist users with hearing impairments.
   - Add audio descriptions for videos to convey visual information for users who are visually impaired.

**Keyboard Accessibility:**
   - Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields) can be accessed and operated using the keyboard alone.
   - Verify that the tab order follows a logical sequence and that users can easily navigate through the page without getting trapped in any element.

**Form Accessibility:**
   - Associate form labels with their respective input fields, either visually or programmatically.
   - Include clear instructions and error messages to guide users in completing the form accurately.

**Content Readability:**
   - Use clear and concise language to enhance content readability for all users.
   - Break content into smaller paragraphs and use bullet points or numbered lists to improve scanability.

**Tables and Data:**
   - Use proper table markup, including header cells (th) and data cells (td), to make data tables accessible.
   - Ensure tables have appropriate row and column headers for screen readers to interpret the data accurately.

**Audio and Video Player Controls:**
    - Verify that media players have easily accessible controls for volume adjustment, playback, and pausing or stopping the content.
    - Ensure that users can operate the media player using both the keyboard and mouse or touch inputs.

**Alternative Content Delivery:**
    - Provide alternative formats, such as downloadable PDFs or HTML versions, for content that might not be accessible in its original format.
    - Offer alternative means of accessing important information, like providing a phone number or email address as an alternative to an online form.

**Consistency and Navigation:**
    - Maintain consistent navigation menus throughout the website to improve user familiarity and ease of use.
    - Include skip navigation links or anchor links to allow users to bypass repetitive content and jump to the main content area.

**Document Accessibility Policies:**
    - Document and share the website's accessibility policy, including contact information for users to report accessibility issues.
    - Regularly review and update the accessibility policy as needed to reflect any changes or improvements.

Remember, while this checklist covers many essential accessibility considerations, it's essential to regularly consult the latest WCAG 2.2 guidelines and accessibility best practices to stay informed about emerging standards and techniques.
